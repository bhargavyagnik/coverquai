## Overview

Coverquai is a Chrome extension designed to help users generate cover letters based on job descriptions. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

When you upload a resume:
- It is processed locally within your browser
- No copies are stored on any external servers
- The content is only used temporarily for cover letter generation

### Third-Party Services
The only external connection made is to the AI service for cover letter generation. During this process:

- Job descriptions are processed anonymously
- No data is retained after generation
